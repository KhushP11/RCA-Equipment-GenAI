MAINTENANCE REPORT
==================

Equipment ID: distillation-column-03
Date: 2023-02-21
Technician: P. Johnson
Work Order: WO-2023-0589
Type: Follow-up Inspection

INSPECTION DETAILS:
------------------
Follow-up inspection of distillation column 03 reboiler system and temperature control components based on previous maintenance recommendations.

FINDINGS:
--------
1. Scale buildup in reboiler has increased to approximately 22% coverage despite partial cleaning.
2. Temperature control valve TCV-301 operation has further deteriorated - now showing 5.7s response time.
3. Observed minor steam leak at reboiler inlet connection B-17.
4. Temperature differential between product outlet and cooling system increased from 45°C to 53°C.
5. Column differential pressure increased from 0.82 bar to 0.91 bar indicating possible tray fouling.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
-------------
1. Tightened reboiler inlet connection B-17 to address steam leak.
2. Made additional PID tuning adjustments to compensate for further valve deterioration.
3. Manually cleared visible fouling from accessible trays.
4. Adjusted feed flow rate temporarily reduced by 5% to compensate for reduced efficiency.
5. Added additional monitoring points to DCS system for temperature trending.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------
1. URGENT: Schedule reboiler cleaning and control valve replacement within 30 days.
2. Implement hourly temperature monitoring protocol for critical points.
3. Prepare for potential unplanned shutdown if temperatures exceed 195°C at any point.
4. Engineering review needed for cooling system capacity and optimization.
