MAINTENANCE REPORT
==================

Equipment ID: distillation-column-03
Date: 2023-02-07
Technician: M. Rodriguez
Work Order: WO-2023-0421
Type: Scheduled Preventive Maintenance

INSPECTION DETAILS:
------------------
Performed quarterly preventive maintenance inspection on distillation column 03 including visual inspection, instrumentation check, and control system verification.

FINDINGS:
--------
1. Temperature control valve TCV-301 shows slightly slower response time than specified (4.8s vs. 3.0s standard).
2. Reboiler heating element inspection revealed 15% scale buildup on heat exchanger surfaces.
3. Temperature sensor TE-305 reading 2.3Â°C lower than redundant sensor TE-306 - within acceptable calibration range but at upper limit.
4. Insulation in good condition with no visible damage or deterioration.
5. All gaskets and flanges secure with no visible leaks.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
-------------
1. Cleaned accessible portions of reboiler heat exchanger.
2. Adjusted PID control parameters to compensate for valve response.
3. Scheduled full descaling of reboiler for next major maintenance window.
4. Documented temperature sensor variance for monitoring in daily operations checks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------
1. Prioritize control valve TCV-301 repair/replacement during next shutdown.
2. Increase frequency of reboiler inspection to monthly until next cleaning opportunity.
3. Recalibrate temperature sensors TE-305 and TE-306 at next opportunity.
