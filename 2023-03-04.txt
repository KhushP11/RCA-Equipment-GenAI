MAINTENANCE REPORT
==================

Equipment ID: distillation-column-03
Date: 2023-03-04
Technician: T. Yamamoto
Work Order: WO-2023-0712
Type: Emergency Response

INSPECTION DETAILS:
------------------
Emergency response call for distillation column 03 after operations reported temperature alarms and control system compensation reaching limits.

FINDINGS:
--------
1. Control valve TCV-301 is now operating in a severely degraded state - response time >10s with visible stem binding.
2. Reboiler heat transfer efficiency decreased by estimated 35% due to scale buildup.
3. DCS monitoring shows gradual temperature increase trend over past 72 hours despite control system compensation.
4. Redundant temperature sensor TE-306 now reading intermittently with signal dropouts.
5. Multiple trays showing signs of coking/fouling restricting vapor flow.
6. Column bottom temperature reached 193.5°C during inspection (approaching alarm setpoint of 195°C).

ACTIONS TAKEN:
-------------
1. Implemented manual control valve bypass procedure to maintain minimum acceptable flow.
2. Applied temporary mechanical support to control valve stem to improve operation.
3. Reduced feed rate by additional 10% to lower heat load.
4. Connected portable temperature monitoring system with independent sensors.
5. Increased cooling water flow to maximum capacity.
6. Added temporary production operator for continuous monitoring.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------
1. CRITICAL: Immediate preparation for controlled shutdown within 24 hours.
2. Emergency procurement of replacement control valve TCV-301.
3. Assemble maintenance team for reboiler cleaning immediately after shutdown.
4. Engineering evaluation of potential thermal damage to column internals required.
5. Incident review needed to address maintenance deferral decisions.
